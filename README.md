It seems you've shared several HTML files, each representing different pages of a portfolio website (About Me, Projects, Skills, Contact Me). Additionally, there are CSS styles embedded within the HTML files. It's a good practice to separate HTML and CSS into different files for better organization and maintainability.

Here's a breakdown of the structure:

1. **About Me Page** (`about.html`):
   - Contains information about the individual, including their profile image, a brief introduction, and their interests.
   - The styling for this page is defined within `<style>` tags in the `<head>` section.

2. **Projects Page** (`projects.html`):
   - Showcases several projects with descriptions and relevant images.
   - Similar to the About Me page, the styling is embedded within the HTML file.

3. **Skills Page** (`skills.html`):
   - Lists the individual's programming skills, experience, and other relevant skills.
   - Styling is also embedded within the HTML file.

4. **Contact Me Page** (`contact.html`):
   - Provides a form for visitors to contact the individual. It includes fields for name, email, phone number, and message.
   - Styling is once again embedded within the HTML file.

5. **Shared CSS**:
   - Some common CSS styles are shared across all pages, like the styling for the navigation bar, header, footer, and general layout.
   - These shared styles could be extracted into a separate CSS file and linked to each HTML page, promoting code reusability and easier maintenance.
